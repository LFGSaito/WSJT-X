.Decode Highlighting

* _WSJT-X_ uses colors to highlight decoded CQ messages of particular
  interest.  Check the box *Show DXCC, grid, and worked-before status*
  on the *Settings | General* tab, and any boxes of interest to you on
  the *Colors* tab.  You can drag any line up or down to raise or
  lower its logical priority.  Right-click any line to set a new
  foreground or background color.  Foreground and background colors
  are applied separately, and careful choices of foreground,
  background, and priority can provide two indications of
  worked-before status.

* Press the *Reset Highlighting* button to reset all of the color
  settings to default values.

* Check *Highlight by Mode* if you wish worked before status to be per
  <<INTRO,mode>>.

* Worked before status is calculated from your _WSJT-X_ ADIF
  <<LOGGING, Logging>> file, you may replace ADIF log file with one
  exported from your station logging application, *Rescan ADIF Log*
  rebuilds the _WSJT-X_ worked before indexes using the current ADIF
  log file.

TIP: The _WSJT-X_ ADIF file records must contain the "CALL" field.
     The "BAND", and "MODE", and "GRIDSQUARE" fields are optional
     depending on your DXing objectives. DXCC entity, continent, CQ,
     and ITU Zone data for call prefixes and certain well known
     overrides are derived from the cty.dat database which is bundled
     with _WSJT-X_ (See <<LOGGING,Logging>> for details).

.Logbook of The World User Validation

Stations who are known to have uploaded their logs to the ARRL LoTW
QSL matching service can be highlighted. The data used to determine
this is available on line.

* *Fetch Now* will download a fresh dataset from the *Users CSV file
   URL*. The LoTW team normally update this data weekly.

* Adjust *Age of of last upload less than* to set the period within
  which a station must have uploaded their log to LoTW to trigger
  highlighting.

TIP: If you are using Windows and experience LoTW download errors, go
here https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html and download the
OpenSSL installer, specifically the “Win32 OpenSSL v1.0.2q Light”
version. Note that this is the correct version even if you are running
64-bit Windows. The direct download link is
https://slproweb.com/download/Win32OpenSSL_Light-1_0_2q.exe.  Run the
installer with all default options and accept the option to install
into the Windows system directory.

TIP: If you cannot install the OpenSSL libraries or do not have an
Internet connection on the computer used to run WSJT-X 2.0, you can
download the LoTW file manually. Go to
https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw-user-activity.csv in a web browser,
download the file, then move it to the WSJT-X log files
directory. This directory can be opened by selecting File | Open log
directory.
