_WSJT-X_ uses colors to highlight decoded CQ messages of particular
interest.  Check the box *Show DXCC, grid, and worked-before status*
on the *Settings | General* tab, and any boxes of interest to you on
the *Colors* tab.  You can drag any line up or down to raise or lower
its logical priority.  Right-click any line to set a new foreground or
background color.  Foreground and background colors are applied
separately, and careful choices of foreground, background, and
priority can provide two indications of worked-before status.
