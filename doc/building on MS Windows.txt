Building WSJT-X on MS Windows
=============================

Here I describe my set up, you  may have other preferences due to your
favoured file system layout for  tools, utilities, and libraries. Many
variations are possible,  use this guide as a template.  The aim is to
provide an environment suitable for general development.

Prerequisite Tools and Libraries
================================

Here is an overview list, details are filled out below:

     * Qt Open Source Framework
     * Cmake build system generator
     * FFTW v3 DFT library
     * libusb usb device library
     * MSYS2 *nix like command line environment
     * Hamlib rig control library
     * Boost C++ libraries

Qt Framework
------------

At the  time of writing I  recommend using Qt v5.15.0  64-bit, v5.15.1
has a defect  that affects us so  is best avoided. You  need the MinGW
version  as we  do not  support  the MSVC  version  due to  lack of  a
suitable FOSS  Fortran complier. To  install the Qt developer  SDK you
should download the official Qt  on-line installer, this allows you to
install one or  more variants of the  Qt SDK and also  to maintain and
update the installation  at a later date. There are  many versions and
components within  versions available, you  only need the  base 64-bit
MinGW framework for Qt v5.15.0,  other components can unchecked within
the on-line installer.  The default install location is C:\Qt which is
fine, do not  attempt to move the location of  the installed libraries
if  you  decide you  want  it  elsewhere,  the installer  patches  the
libraries for  the installed location  and it is easier  to un-install
and re-install if you wish to change the installed location.

CMake
-----

Download  and install  a recent  version from  the official  CMake web
site. A  default installation is  fine. I am currently  using v3.18.3,
versions as old as v3.9 should work.

Other tools and libraries without installers
--------------------------------------------

For small  libraries that  don't have a  Windows installer  and change
often  I locate  them under  a directory  C:\Tools.  This  location is
arbitrary and just used to aggregate such items in one place, but this
document assumes that location so you may need to adjust paths etc. if
you use a different location.

FFTW v3 DFT library
-------------------

The   MS   Windows   builds   of  FFTW3   can   be   downloaded   from
http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html  and unzipped  into C:\Tools.
You only need the 64-bit package.

libusb library
--------------

This  library  is  available  from  https://libusb.info/,  unzip  this
package into C:\Tools.

MSYS2
-----

This  utility is  available  from  https://www.msys2.org/. Follow  the
download and installation instructions there.
